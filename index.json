In particular the fundamental one from the Gang of Four (GoF).\nI created a repository that acts as a collection of C++ implementations of these patterns. The GoF patterns are all presents but in the future I’m planning to add also the “extra” patterns (at the moment only the null object is present).\nCreational Design Pattern Description Abstract Factory Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Builder Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. Factory Method Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses. Prototype Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. Singleton Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Structural Design Pattern Description Adapter Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class. Bridge Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite Composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object. Decorator Dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object. Facade Provides a simplified interface to a large body of code. Flyweight Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects. Proxy Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity. Behavioral Design Pattern Description Chain of Responsibility Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects. Command Creates objects that encapsulate actions and parameters. Interpreter Implements a specialized language. Iterator Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Mediator Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods. Memento Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo). Observer Is a publish/subscribe pattern, which allows some observer objects to see an event. State Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Strategy Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime. Template Method Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior. Visitor Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object. During this exploration I discovered many interesting aspects of software engineering by exploring this field, especially a concept of scope level design patterns. Some design patterns can be applied directly on the repository (code level, so in micro), like the GoF patterns or concurrency patterns for MT paradigms.\nOther design patterns acts on an higher level of abstraction, and these are called architectural patterns. Some of them are widely known like the MVC (Model-View-Controller) or n-tier, but most of them are new to me.\nIn the future I would like to write a blog post about them with diagrams and explanations, seems a good idea for studying them in a fun way 😁\n","date":1703600240,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703600240,"objectID":"f225fd6ec0dceba39239c1556e9d85a1","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/project/design-patterns/","publishdate":"2023-12-26T14:17:20Z","relpermalink":"/project/design-patterns/","section":"project","summary":"Personal project","tags":["Software Engineering","Programming"],"title":"Design Patterns in C++","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Latest post update: 19 November 2023, 13:32 UTC +1h\n🚨 The whole blog post is a work in progress! 🚨 When you see 🚨, this is a suggestion for the creator of the post (me), to update this blog post since I’m not following any structure, I’m just writing as it came out and adjusting by re-reading and rewriting the post 😊\nSince when I was a kid I wanted to know as much as I could, I received my first computer when i was 8 years old, and since then I got hooked from internet, video games and programming.\nI stop talking about this side of my self (I will do it in another post), the thing that I wanted to introduce is that I would like to have a way for quantify, store, and expand my knowledge.\n🚨 Question to answer for the post:\nWhy I created this post?

These data structures are characterized by the use of a semi-regular subdivision of a medium-resolution “base mesh,” followed by displacement of the generated vertices. Variants introduced may include the adoption of an anisotropic subdivision step, the adoption of an irregular recursive subdivision scheme, or others.\nDependencies Qt OpenGL Mathematics The headers are placed in the directory Dependencies\\GLM PyMeshLab Sample models As sample models in this repository, I’ve prepared different versions of Pallas Cat by printable_models\nPython script (empirical analysis) Executing this script will generate n samples for both subdivision schemes (current and variant).

Maps are surely a fascinating tool for geographers and curious people, but they are just a little part of Geography.\nFirst of all, Geography is a science, it is the study of the earth’s surface (in all its various aspects of it, e.g. extension, distribution, biological, social, …) and the relationship between people and their environments.\nAs we can state, Geography is much bigger than Cartography and Topography, since it adds the investigation of dynamics and causes of the position of the Earth in space caused by phenomena and based on its characteristics.\nFrom Wikipedia :\nCartography is the set of scientific, technical, and artistic knowledge aimed at the representation, symbolic, but truthful, on flat (geographical maps) or spherical (globes) supports, of geographical, statistical, demographic, economic, political, cultural, relative to the geographic space represented. Topography is the science that has as its purpose the determination and metric representation through drawing a map with conventional signs of the Earth’s surface. There are several branches of Geography, by the way, this intro was just for making clear that learning country maps it’s different from learning Geography.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Geography you should consider these resources :\nCrash Course Geography from CrashCourse on YouTube, seems the best way to start, I can’t wait for watching it.\nOther must lectures are “Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Explain Everything About the World (Politics of Place)“, and “The Power of Geography: Ten Maps That Reveal the Future of Our World” both by Tim Marshall.\n“Geografia umana. Un approccio visuale“, by Alyson L. Greiner, Giuseppe Dematteis and Carla Lanza. I found only the italian version of this book (I still have to read this).\nAs an alternative, this seems similar to “Human Geography A Spatial Perspective AP Edition” by Sarah Bednarz, Mark Bockenhauer, and Fredrik Hiebert. Why should we learn the world map? From elementary school to middle school Geography is taught in general terms about the seas and the land. But after this time in school, this wonderful subject isn’t taught anymore, leaving it in the most incomplete manner possible.\nMy personal experience was that at the end of these classes I still had no idea how countries were positioned in the world.\nGeography is not considered as important as Math, English, History, and other core subjects, by the way, is a tool that gives you an important enrichment to a well-rounded education.\nA list of things we still don’t know about the normal scholastic system:\nThe spatial position of world countries The spatial position of seas World capitals The flags of the countries The current wars Exactly, wars, and modern Geography if studied from the correct resources (which will be given on this page) can tell you a lot about the current global situation of the world, this will result in a knowledge boost if you are willing to study History (and you probably should).\nWhy you should study geography? You could study the world map just to impress people, but this isn’t the main superpower that is given by Geography, there are many others. If you know better Geography you can understand better Politics, History, and also human behavior.\nThere are many types of Geography, one is also called mathematical geography, it’s okay we won’t go into that 😋; we are interested in physical geography, which is the study of the physical characteristics of the land like climate, water distribution, and natural resources.\nIf you want to have a better economical and political idea, you should study physical geography for mainly two things\nSpatial awareness on the globe Natural resources awareness The first will hugely impact your world of view because you were considering only the continent in which you are inhabiting and not the world as a whole. The second is complementary to the first one for understanding why some places are really important to the global market.\nHow you should study the world map? There is much software out there, I prepared this program of application to use that works kinda like an intensive memorization course of maps for complete beginners.\nLet’s try to attack the first point, we want to gain awareness about where the countries are placed, and possibly where their capital is also placed.\nThe first software you will use is Google Maps, this was obvious but it is essential for exploring in-depth the countries and cities that you are going to study with other software. Many of these are android apps and are developed by Andrey Solovyev (this is the blog of all his games), except the last one which is a deck for Anki (if you don’t know what is Anki, you should read this article by Michael Owen on active recall, and this from Farnam Street for spaced repetition).\nI put there an ordered list of the applications I suggest respecting the ordering to have a better learning experience.\nAll maps quiz World flags quiz …","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"346d563a77b53c497382415e574e4c61","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/post/should-learn-geography/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/should-learn-geography/","section":"post","summary":"Geography is not just about maps.","tags":["Geography","Learning","Knowledge","Memory"],"title":"Why should you learn geography?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"GPU Computing Course, July 2021, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi\nAbout the project During the course of GPU Computing I decided to implement my old version of the Ray Tracer (based on the Ray Tracing in One Weekend from Peter Shirley ) on CUDA.

Participants were subjected to an external heat-pain stimulus through a physical device.\nTheir facial expressions and biophysical signals were recorded using cameras and the application of electrodes, then features were extracted. The descriptors came from two different modalities and will be combined by testing both fusion approaches. Finally, classifications and accuracy estimates were made, based on which it was possible to determine that early fusion is the most accurate approach for the dataset considered.\nFor more information about the project download the report. Pain stimulation occurs in patients through electrostimulators applied to the wrists. When this experiment is performed different bio-potential signals (GSR, EMG, …) and facial expressions are recorded through (through a video camera).\nThe analysis phase involves extracting features from the video signals through computer vision techniques. The features involved are Euclidean distances on particular facial landmarks and gradients on 5 regions of the face.\nOnce the biopotential signals and video features are ready, fusion techniques are used to perform classification.\nEarly fusion involves fusing signals and video features a priori concerning classification. Then train the classifier on the combined inputs. Late fusion involves training three classifiers (of the same type) on different inputs (ECG, GSR, and video), then for each sample in the testing set its prediction is calculated with all three classifiers. The majority prediction is considered; if that prediction coincides with the ground truth, then that prediction is considered correct. The classifier used in this project was Support Vector Machines.\nVideo feature extraction Tools IntelliJ IDEA and Python for developing the project application.

This average is again weighted by the number of frames in the video window(which in the dataset was 5 seconds).\nSwitch button There is a debug branch called cv-features in this repository where you can try computer vision systems directly with your computer camera.

The systems run on a centralized MQTT server which manages the taxis, they are able to communicate with each other via gRPC to ensure access to the resource.\nDev Tools \u0026amp; Languages Languages Java SDK 18.0.2 Technologies gRPC MQTT REST API Protocol Buffers Tools IntelliJ IDEA draw.io for drawing diagrams Git \u0026amp; GitHub as versioning system Within this README are different conceptual diagrams that broadly define the general operation of the system, distributed algorithms, and synchronization procedures.\nThese diagrams do not rigidly follow any model as they are simple and extensively commented.\nGuidelines Rhombuses correspond to flow controls. Rectangles to of operations/procedures. Green circles are collection points. Rectangle colors stand for an object belonging to a certain class (so if there are multiple rectangles of the same color, they are multiple instances of the same class). White circles correspond to processes (used in diagrams for distributed algorithms). Gray circles correspond to threads (used in diagrams for synchronization). General functioning of the project This is an outline of general operation of the system, it corresponds to what is required in the assignment delivery document.\nDistributed algorithms diagrams Ricart \u0026amp; Agrawala algorithm for mutual exclusion The algorithm was developed for guarantee the mutual exclusion to a critical section between multiple processes in a distributed system.\nThe timestamps of the messages are sent in broadcast (in parallel) through the gRPC call coordinateRechargeStream(). The logical clock synchronization is guaranteed through Lamport’s algorithm.\nLet’s consider the following diagram, the nodes in red want to access to the critical section, while the other nodes are doing anything else.\nMore in depth in the first phase (in which the requests are parallelized) the processes will build their lists of dependent nodes. These lists will contain all the nodes which got a smaller timestamp relative to their.\nA node will be able to enter a critical section (i.e., in this project is the recharging operation) if it receives the ACKs from all the other nodes. If this doesn’t happens it will have to wait the residual ACKs.\nOnce that a node has finished with the recharging operation, it will sends an ACK message to the taxi of his list/queue. The first taxis who will fill the number of attended ACKs will access the critical section, and then story repeats.\nRide election algorithm The SETA process generates two rides each 5 seconds on a random district, these two rides are posted on the respective topic of the district. Each taxi is subscribed only on the topic of the district in which it currently belongs.\nFor simplicity let’s assume only one ride (the ride 5) to be published from the SETA process on the first district. All the processes which are subscribed to this topic (inside the green circle) will receive the message for the ride 5.\nAn election mechanism will start through the gRPC call coordinateRideStream(), the request will be performed in broadcast (also to taxi out from district 1) and they will be executed in parallel. The request will contain the Euclidean distance to the starting point, the battery levels and the ID of taxi which is sending the request.\nFor sake of simplicity we are seeing the evolution of the algorithm only from the point of view of the process 1.\nLet’s also assume that the process 1 is the process with the smallest distance from the starting point of the ride. Essentially, this means that the taxi who receives the request will all answer with an ACK (this means that they got a worst distance, battery or grater ID respect to process 1), only in this case the process 1 will achieve the consensus.\nNow the process 1 can execute the ride 5, before it even pass to the local execution of the ride, it publish a message containing the ride 5 on the seta/smartcity/completed topic. This will allow to stop recycling this message (we will see what is it below) and also making know to the taxi which ride ignore since it is already taken.\nThis because all the taxi will have a local list containing all the completed rides taken from the topic, in this way they know which ride to avoid.\nRide recycling There is a system that enforces the recycling of runs, each run that is generated on the topics is embedded within the relative queue of the district. The priority of the queues is based on the order (run ID) of run generation, so older runs will be preferred.\nConceptual schemes of synchronizations User input Command entry by users is handled by two threads.

The aims of this project was to study how the tessellation works with simple domains and to implement the basic logic for triangulate the vertices of simple objects like cubes and then with more complex like torus, sphere and cylinder.\nFor the course project there was also a need to produce a report in the form of website (fully in italian) which is hosted from the university\u0026#39;s mathematics department Federigo Enriques. It contains the theory behind the software, the technique involved, user manual of the application and lot of example videos about the application. Is possible to download the source code of the project from the GitHub Repository by following this link. The course was a complete math course and the project was developed using the OpenGL specification.\nBy accessing the authors section of the course website, is possible to read under my name a note from the course teacher saying: “has developed the project related to the triangulation and tessellation of the lateral surface of some geometric solids obtaining truly amazing visual effects.” - Prof. Alzati\n","date":1624752e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624752e3,"objectID":"12519c8edd74f86a00c8822035310e0e","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/project/geometry/","publishdate":"2021-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geometry/","section":"project","summary":"Study and implementation of computational geometry techniques with OpenGL.","tags":["Computer Graphics","Math"],"title":"Subdivision of surfaces","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
