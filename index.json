In particular the fundamental ones from the Gang of Four (GoF).\nI created a repository that serves as a collection of C++ implementations of these patterns. All the GoF patterns are present, but in the future I plan to add the “extra” patterns as well (currently only the null object is included).\nCreational Design Pattern Description Abstract Factory Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Builder Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. Factory Method Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses. Prototype Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. Singleton Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Structural Design Pattern Description Adapter Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class. Bridge Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite Composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object. Decorator Dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object. Facade Provides a simplified interface to a large body of code. Flyweight Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects. Proxy Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity. Behavioral Design Pattern Description Chain of Responsibility Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects. Command Creates objects that encapsulate actions and parameters. Interpreter Implements a specialized language. Iterator Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Mediator Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods. Memento Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo). Observer Is a publish/subscribe pattern, which allows some observer objects to see an event. State Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Strategy Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime. Template Method Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior. Visitor Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object. During this exploration, I discovered many interesting aspects of software engineering, especially the concept of scope-level design patterns. Some design patterns can be applied directly to the codebase (code level, or micro), such as the GoF patterns or concurrency patterns for multi-threaded paradigms.\nOther design patterns act on a higher level of abstraction, and these are called architectural patterns. Some of them are widely known, such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) or n-tier architecture, but most are new to me.\nIn the future, I would like to write a blog post about them with diagrams and explanations. It seems like a good idea for studying them in a fun way 😁\n","date":1703600240,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703600240,"objectID":"f225fd6ec0dceba39239c1556e9d85a1","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/project/design-patterns/","publishdate":"2023-12-26T14:17:20Z","relpermalink":"/project/design-patterns/","section":"project","summary":"Personal project","tags":["Software Engineering","Programming"],"title":"Design Patterns in C++","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Master’s Thesis, October 2023, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMI\nAbstract This thesis aims to empirically investigate the imaginable performance for data structures suitable for effectively representing extreme-resolution 3D polygonal surfaces designed for multi-resolution rendering on GPUs.\nTo this end, supporting algorithms will be designed, implemented, and tested that transform “traditional” (i.e., indexed) high-resolution triangular meshes into the analyzed data structures, and then measure the approximation errors introduced through appropriate geometric measurements.\nOther alternative schemes will be studied, which are considered variants of the so-called “micro-meshes” scheme offered by the latest generation of vendor-specific GPU hardware. These data structures are characterized by the use of a semi-regular subdivision of a medium-resolution “base mesh,” followed by displacement of the generated vertices. Variants introduced may include the adoption of an anisotropic subdivision step, the adoption of an irregular recursive subdivision scheme, or others.\nDependencies Qt OpenGL Mathematics The headers are placed in the directory Dependencies\\GLM PyMeshLab Sample models As sample models in this repository, I’ve prepared different versions of Pallas Cat by printable_models\nPython script (empirical analysis) Executing this script will generate n samples for both subdivision schemes (current and variant).

Participants were subjected to an external heat pain stimulus using a physical device.\nFacial expressions and biophysical signals were recorded using cameras and electrodes, after which features were extracted. The descriptors from two different modalities were combined by testing both fusion approaches. Finally, classifications and accuracy estimates were made, based on which it was possible to determine that early fusion is the most accurate approach for the dataset considered.\nFor more information about the project download the report. Pain stimulation occurs in patients through electrostimulators applied to the wrists. During this experiment, different biophysical signals (GSR, EMG, …) and facial expressions are recorded using a video camera.\nThe analysis phase involves extracting features from the video signals using computer vision techniques. The features are Euclidean distances between specific facial landmarks and gradients in five regions of the face.\nOnce the biophysical signals and video features are ready, fusion techniques are used for classification.\nEarly fusion involves combining signals and video features before classification, then training the classifier on the combined inputs. Late fusion involves training three classifiers (of the same type) on different inputs (ECG, GSR, and video). For each sample in the testing set, the prediction is calculated with all three classifiers. The majority prediction is considered correct if it matches the ground truth. The classifier used in this project was Support Vector Machines.\nVideo feature extraction Tools IntelliJ IDEA and Python for developing the project application. Microsoft Excel for working with the .csv files. BioVid dataset. Dependencies OpenCV MediaPipe Sk-learn Numpy Computer vision techniques The computer vision techniques used were for the extraction of facial distances, gradients of facial folds, and head position.\nFacial distances and head pose estimation Gradient for face folds Gradients allow changes in regions of the face to be assessed. An arithmetic average of pixel values in these regions is calculated. This average is then weighted by the number of frames in the video window (5 seconds in this dataset).\nSwitch button A debug branch called cv-features in this repository allows you to test computer vision systems directly with your computer’s camera. Using the tab key you can enable and disable debugging for gradients.\nIdeas for future extensions Calculate the gradient only when the pain stimulus is activated and not over the entire window. … ","date":1624752e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624752e3,"objectID":"21652ec8d7d8715d90ea4beaae64d756","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/project/pain-recognition/","publishdate":"2021-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pain-recognition/","section":"project","summary":"Test the accuracy of early and late fusion approaches on a multi-modal dataset to classify the presence of pain in patients.","tags":["Computer Vision","AI","Misc"],"title":"Pain Recognition - Dataset analysis and experimental validation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Distributed and Pervasive Systems courses, Jun 2022, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi\nAbout the project Project for the course of “Distributed and Pervasive Systems” A.A. 2021/2022 for M.Sc.’s in Computer Science.\nThe objective of the project is to design and develop SETA (Self-driving TAxi service), a Self-driving peer-to-peer taxi system for citizens of a smart city. The systems run on a centralized MQTT server which manages the taxis, they are able to communicate with each other via gRPC to ensure access to the resource.\nDev Tools \u0026amp; Languages Languages Java SDK 18.0.2 Technologies gRPC MQTT REST API Protocol Buffers Tools IntelliJ IDEA draw.io for drawing diagrams Git \u0026amp; GitHub as versioning system Within this README are different conceptual diagrams that broadly define the general operation of the system, distributed algorithms, and synchronization procedures.\nThese diagrams do not rigidly follow any model as they are simple and extensively commented.\nGuidelines Rhombuses correspond to flow controls. Rectangles to of operations/procedures. Green circles are collection points. Rectangle colors stand for an object belonging to a certain class (so if there are multiple rectangles of the same color, they are multiple instances of the same class). White circles correspond to processes (used in diagrams for distributed algorithms). Gray circles correspond to threads (used in diagrams for synchronization). General functioning of the project This is an outline of general operation of the system, it corresponds to what is required in the assignment delivery document.\nDistributed algorithms diagrams Ricart \u0026amp; Agrawala algorithm for mutual exclusion The algorithm was developed for guarantee the mutual exclusion to a critical section between multiple processes in a distributed system.\nThe timestamps of the messages are sent in broadcast (in parallel) through the gRPC call coordinateRechargeStream(). The logical clock synchronization is guaranteed through Lamport’s algorithm.\nConsider the following diagram: the nodes in red want to access the critical section, while the other nodes are doing something else.\nIn more depth, in the first phase (in which the requests are parallelized), the processes will build their lists of dependent nodes. These lists will contain all the nodes which got a smaller timestamp relative to theirs.\nA node will be able to enter a critical section (i.e., the recharging operation in this project) if it receives acknowledgments from all other nodes. If this doesn’t happen, it will have to wait for the remaining acknowledgments.\nOnce a node has finished the recharging operation, it sends an ACK message to the taxis in its list/queue. The first taxi to receive the required number of acknowledgments will access the critical section, and then the process repeats.\nRide election algorithm The SETA process generates two rides each 5 seconds on a random district, these two rides are posted on the respective topic of the district. Each taxi is subscribed only on the topic of the district in which it currently belongs.\nFor simplicity, let’s assume only one ride (ride 5) is published by the SETA process on the first district. All processes subscribed to this topic (inside the green circle) will receive the message for ride 5.\nAn election mechanism will start through the gRPC call coordinateRideStream(). The request will be broadcast (including to taxis outside district 1) and executed in parallel. The request will contain the Euclidean distance to the starting point, the battery levels and the ID of taxi which is sending the request.\nFor simplicity, we are examining the evolution of the algorithm from the perspective of process 1.\nLet’s also assume that process 1 has the smallest distance from the ride’s starting point. Essentially, this means that the taxis receiving the request will all answer with an ACK (meaning they have a worse distance, battery level, or greater ID than process 1). Only then will process 1 achieve consensus.\nNow process 1 can execute ride 5. Before it passes to local execution of the ride, it publishes a message containing ride 5 on the seta/smartcity/completed topic. This allows stopping the recycling of this message (we will see what this is below) and informs taxis which rides to ignore since they are already taken.\nThis is because all taxis will have a local list containing all the completed rides from the topic, so they know which rides to avoid.\nRide recycling A system enforces ride recycling. Each ride generated on the topics is embedded within the respective district queue. The queue priority is based on ride generation order (ride ID), so older rides are preferred.\nConceptual schemes of synchronizations User input Command entry by users is handled by two threads. One thread for reading and executing the commands entered (CLI, Command Line Interface), and one thread for controlling the input stream (Input Checker).\nThis approach is designed in such a way as to avoid “busy …","date":1624752e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624752e3,"objectID":"c1a85b272412065daaa52e9fa8ee0ca4","permalink":"https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/project/seta/","publishdate":"2021-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/seta/","section":"project","summary":"Design and development of a peer-to-peer self-driving taxi service for a smart city, with distributed mutual exclusion and ride election algorithms.","tags":["Distributed Systems","Misc"],"title":"SETA - SElf-driving TA-xi service","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Computational Geometry Course, March 2021, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi\nAbout the project Icosahedron obtained with the application.
