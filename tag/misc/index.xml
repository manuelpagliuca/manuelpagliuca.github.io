&lt;p>This was a project I made for the course of Real-time Graphics Programming. The course provided extensive knowledge about real-time computer graphics (you can check the
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/Appunti_RTGP.pdf" target="_blank">notes&lt;/a>
I took). At the end of the course, in addition to an oral exam, there was a project related to graphic programming to be developed with OpenGL. I asked Prof. Gadia if there was the possibility of developing it with Vulkan, he granted me the possibility to take this extra-step, it was very tiring but fruitful from the point of view of learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project consists in a deferred renderer to improve the overall efficiency of the application in the usage of lights. The scene is composed of three models of the same character, a floor and twenty lights (whose movement and color can be modified), there is the
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/DEFERRED_RENDERING___RTGP.pdf" target="_blank">notes&lt;/a>
containing the various metrics obtained using a different number of lights. The GitHub repository is accessible at

The complete title of the thesis is &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Fix-it : Stream processing on event-driven system for
managing public disservices&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. The project itself consist in developing an &lt;strong>E.D.A.&lt;/strong> (Event-Driven Application)
system that will work on a mobile application called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Fix-it&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, which is developed using Android
Studio. The system is implemented with &lt;strong>Google Firebase&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Apache Kafka&lt;/strong> (stream processing).
Different technologies involved in the implementation of this project like REST API, Stream Processing and
Publisher-Subscribe pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project was developed only by just two guys, we used the concepts of the Agile Manifesto to design our workflow, everything was organized with a Kanban Board on Trello so that we could work consistently by breaking the work down into small parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole thesis is downloadable as PDF
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/Manuel_Pagliuca_Tesi.pdf" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>
, was
written using LaTeX on Overleaf, the Abstract is downloadable

I attained a presentation of my thesis on Google Meet due to COVID-19, and I talked about my
work using these
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/Slides.pdf" target="_blank">slides&lt;/a>
. The project was realized under the

&lt;p>This is a project for the course of A.I. for VideoGames at University of Milan, A.Y. 2021/2022. The aim of the project is to implement a Lindenmayer system for procedural generation of tree using discrete distributions (pseudo-random integers) for enhancing the believability of the project.&lt;/p>
