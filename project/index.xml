&lt;p>During the course of &lt;strong>GPU Computing&lt;/strong> I decided to implement my old version of the Ray Tracer (based on the
&lt;em>Ray Tracing in One
Weekend&lt;/em> from
&lt;a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" target="_blank">Peter Shirley&lt;/a>
)
on &lt;strong>CUDA&lt;/strong>. In
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/GPU_COMPUTING___RAY_TRACER.pdf" target="_blank">this&lt;/a>
paper I compared
the two Ray Tracers underlining the
huge differences in rendering speed (even without achieving the best warp efficiency).&lt;br>&lt;br>
For the comparison I used the same scene in both the implementation composed by 8 different spheres with
different
materials between &lt;em>lambertian&lt;/em>, &lt;em>metal&lt;/em> and &lt;em>dielectrics&lt;/em>. I highly recommend to check the comparisons
and metrics at the end of the paper, the GitHub repository is at

&lt;p>This was a project I made for the course of Real-time Graphics Programming. The course provided extensive knowledge about real-time computer graphics (you can check the
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/Appunti_RTGP.pdf" target="_blank">notes&lt;/a>
I took). At the end of the course, in addition to an oral exam, there was a project related to graphic programming to be developed with OpenGL. I asked Prof. Gadia if there was the possibility of developing it with Vulkan, he granted me the possibility to take this extra-step, it was very tiring but fruitful from the point of view of learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project consists in a deferred renderer to improve the overall efficiency of the application in the usage of lights. The scene is composed of three models of the same character, a floor and twenty lights (whose movement and color can be modified), there is the
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/DEFERRED_RENDERING___RTGP.pdf" target="_blank">notes&lt;/a>
containing the various metrics obtained using a different number of lights. The GitHub repository is accessible at

The complete title of the thesis is &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Fix-it : Stream processing on event-driven system for
managing public disservices&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. The project itself consist in developing an &lt;strong>E.D.A.&lt;/strong> (Event-Driven Application)
system that will work on a mobile application called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Fix-it&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, which is developed using Android
Studio. The system is implemented with &lt;strong>Google Firebase&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Apache Kafka&lt;/strong> (stream processing).
Different technologies involved in the implementation of this project like REST API, Stream Processing and
Publisher-Subscribe pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project was developed only by just two guys, we used the concepts of the Agile Manifesto to design our workflow, everything was organized with a Kanban Board on Trello so that we could work consistently by breaking the work down into small parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole thesis is downloadable as PDF
&lt;a href="https://manuelpagliuca.github.io/uploads/Manuel_Pagliuca_Tesi.pdf" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>

written using LaTeX on Overleaf, the Abstract is downloadable

I attained a presentation of my thesis on Google Meet due to COVID-19, and I talked about my
work using these

&lt;p>This is a project for the course of A.I. for VideoGames at University of Milan, A.Y. 2021/2022. The aim of the project is to implement a Lindenmayer system for procedural generation of tree using discrete distributions (pseudo-random integers) for enhancing the believability of the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a unified project for the courses Affective Computing and Natural Interaction at
&lt;a href="https://phuselab.di.unimi.it/">PhuseLab&lt;/a>
, University of Milan, A.Y. 2021/2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of this project is to test the accuracy of &lt;strong>early&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>late fusion&lt;/strong> approaches on a multi-modal dataset to classify the presence of pain in patients. Participants were subjected to an external heat-pain stimulus through a physical device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their &lt;em>facial expressions&lt;/em> and biophysical signals were recorded using cameras and the application of electrodes, then features were extracted. The descriptors came from two different modalities and will be combined by testing both fusion approaches. Finally, classifications and accuracy estimates were made, based on which it was possible to determine that early fusion is the most accurate approach for the dataset considered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The analysis phase involves extracting features from the video signals through &lt;strong>computer vision&lt;/strong> techniques. The features involved are Euclidean distances on particular facial landmarks and gradients on 5 regions of the face.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The computer vision techniques used were for the extraction of facial distances, gradients of facial folds, and head position&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The aims of this project was to study how the tessellation works with simple domains and to
implement the basic logic for triangulate the vertices of simple
objects like cubes and then with more complex like torus, sphere and cylinder.&lt;/p>

For the course project there was also a need to produce a report in the form of &lt;a
href="http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/apps/trietas/index.html">website&lt;/a>
(fully in &lt;i>italian&lt;/i>) which is hosted from the university's mathematics department &lt;i>Federigo Enriques&lt;/i>. It contains
the theory behind the software, the technique involved, user manual of the application and lot of example videos about the application.
&lt;p>Is possible to download the source code of the project from the &lt;a
href="https://github.com/manuelpagliuca/Computational_Geometry_2021">GitHub Repository&lt;/a> by
following this link. The course was a complete math course and the project was developed using the
&lt;strong>OpenGL&lt;/strong> specification.&lt;/p>

href="http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/corso/autori.html">authors
section&lt;/a> of the course website, is possible to read under my
name a note from the course teacher saying: &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;has developed the project related to the triangulation and tessellation of the lateral
surface of some geometric solids obtaining truly amazing visual effects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> - Prof. Alzati&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
